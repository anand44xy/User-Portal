This project is a **Full-Stack User Management Portal** built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** for the backend. The application allows administrators to manage users by providing features like user registration, editing, deletion, and toggling their active/inactive status. The design is responsive, optimized for various screen sizes, and includes a show/hide password functionality for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js to communicate with the backend API.
- **React Toastify**: For displaying toast notifications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building responsive UIs.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons used for buttons (e.g., delete and edit).

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express.js**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB** (assumed): NoSQL database for storing user data.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB instance running (optional: MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anand44xy/user-management-portal.git
    cd user-management-portal
    ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up MongoDB**: 
    If you are using MongoDB locally, ensure that it's running, or configure your MongoDB Atlas connection string in the backend environment variables.

5. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the backend API server on `http://localhost:5000`.

6. **Start the frontend React app**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```
    The React app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

7. **Test the application**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view and use the User Management Portal.
